        For example, say your developers have come up with the perfect
        amortization program and you want to install it on the workgroup server
        for other systems to remotely mount and use. Because this is a
        third-party or custom application, the logical place for it is in
        /usr/local/appname, possibly with a link to the program binary in the
        /usr/local/bin directory (because that's in the path).
      </p>

      <p>Alert</p>
      <p>
        If given a choice between putting the software package bigprog in the
        /usr/local/bigprog section and the /opt/bigprog section, it's hard to
        choose. Read any relevant exam question closely--the main difference
        being that the /opt section is not considered to be sharable, whereas
        the /usr section is often shared and mounted by client systems.

      <h2>File Management Commands</h2>
      <p>
        A major section of the 101 exam is dedicated to how to run commands
        properly with the right options and arguments. As a good sysadmin,
        you'll be expected to know how to create, delete, edit, set permissions
        on, display, move, copy, and determine the type of files and programs.
      </p>

      <p>Alert</p>
      <p>
        You must be able to pick proper and working commands out of lists of
        possibilities, type in appropriate strings in fill-in-the-blank boxes,
        and in general show that you've run the programs and utilities in
        question.

      <h3>Tips for working with Linux files</h3>
      <p>
        Because most users and sysadmins come from a Windows or other OS
        background, a quick set of recommendations for the less-experienced can
        be of help here:
      </p>

      <p>
        > Hidden files aren't really hidden - They just begin with a ., such as
        the .bashrc and .bash_profile files. These are not viewable by normal
        users with conventional commands and switches and aren't deleted by
        commands such as rm -f *.*.
      </p>

      <p>
        > Filenames can contain multiple periods or no period characters - The
        filenames this.is.a.long.file and thisisalongfile are perfectly
        reasonable and possible.
      </p>

      <p>
        > Spaces in filenames look nice, but are a pain to type - Use an _ or a
        - instead of spaces because it's neater and easier than prefixing all
        spaces with a \. (To display a space in a filename, the system shows a
        space prefixes with a backslash.)
